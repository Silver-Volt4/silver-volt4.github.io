# Well, how to start?

"Why not code my own blog site" I thought to myself. Cue two-ish hours later and this part of the site was brought to life.

After a bit of a back-and-forth about what to use for writing blog posts, I settled on Markdown. To integrate it into my tech stack, I used [vite-plugin-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-markdown) to automatically translate my posts into HTML which is then used by SvelteKit. Neat!

Not sure if I'm gonna post here regularly or forgot about this completely. But I made it!

Maybe I should spice up the design of my site next...

Until then!
